### 🎓 Certifications

- **Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)**

### ✨ My Journey

My career began in the realm of **front-end and mobile development**, where I gained valuable experience building dynamic and user-friendly applications. I also explored **3D web development** and created my personal portfolio using technologies like WebGL and Three.js. Driven by a passion for security, I earned my **CPTS certification** and shifted my focus towards penetration testing, applying my development knowledge to identify and mitigate security risks in both web and mobile applications.

### 🔐 My Journey to CPTS

Earning my **CPTS certification** involved successfully completing a real-world simulation exam. During this exam, I was required to exploit a given domain within a 10-day timeframe. This intensive assessment tested my ability to uncover and exploit vulnerabilities, followed by compiling a comprehensive professional report detailing the findings and remediation recommendations. This experience not only solidified my technical skills but also emphasized the importance of clear and effective communication in cybersecurity.

### 🛠️ Projects

Here are a few of the projects I've worked on:

- **🎨 3DPortfolio**: Created a personal portfolio using 3D web technologies like WebGL and Three.js.
- **🛡️ ActiveDirectoryPentest**: Simulated attack scenarios on a Windows Active Directory environment.
